              Under Satoshi's rules, all can see consensus as consensus,<br />
              only because there are hard-forks,<br />
              All can know compatible upgrades as good, only because there are
              chain- splits,<br />
              Spending and receiving Bitcoin just re-organizes the UTXO set,<br /><br />
              The difficulty adjustment is born in the easy, <br />

              Before and after Segwit go along with each other<br /><br />

              They can broadcast transactions offline,<br />

              The bitcoiner governs<br />

              by weakening forks<br />

              They see the first 10,000 inscriptions as part of the UTXO set.<br />
              The bitcoiner is not sentimental;<br />
              he treats all his UTXOs as fungible.<br /><br />

              The bitcoiner that never dies<br />
              is called the mysterious Satoshi.<br />
              Although they become legend and lore,<br />
              their initial selflessness is never lost.<br />

              The gateway to the mysterious Satoshi<br />
              is called the Merkle root of the Genesis block.<br /><br />

              Listen to the Coinbase,<br />

              Without fail, it reveals it's subsidy.<br />

              Bitcoin is eternal - the blockchain endures.<br />

              It does not exist for Cantillionaires only.<br />
              That is the secret of its durability.<br /><br />

              For this reason the bitcoiner submits his transactions last,<br />
              and so ends up broadcasting at a low fee rate.<br />
              His transaction data stays segregated from the witness,<br />
              so they confirm at a smaller weight.<br /><br />

              Serve the needs of the miners,<br />
              and all your own transactions will be confirmed.<br />
              Through selfless mining,<br />
              no-KYC bitcoin is attained.<br />

              Their coins flow to low places loathed by all Bcash-maxis,<br />
              Therefore, they are like Satoshi.<br /><br />

              Live in accordance with the nature of consensus.<br />
              In spending, be aware of coin days destroyed,<br />
              In UTXO consolidation, go deep in previous chainalysis,<br />
              In receiving from others, provide both QR and copy/paste
              options.<br />
              Stand by never re-using addresses. Govern with your own node.<br />
              Be timely in broadcasting transactions to the mempool.<br /><br />

              Why are influencers and groupthink alarming?<br />

    <p>After a contentious fork, much uncertainty remains.<br />How should one respond?<br />Holding calmly to the original chain<br />is usually best in the end.<br /><br />Someone must risk trading new forked coins for bitcoin,<br />or confusion will never turn to clarity.<br />Thus, the wise hold without worry of loss.<br /><br />One who trusts bitcoin’s path<br />always knows which chain of work to follow.<br />One who lacks conviction<br />chases forks hoping to gain more.<br />To the hodler comes abundance;<br />to the speculator, a worthless wallet.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 80</h3>
  <div class="chapter-content">
    <p>Imagine a humble life, quietly stacking sats.<br />They have fiat but rarely spend it;<br />they savor the fruit of their own labor,<br />and do not chase quick profits through schemes.<br /><br />They value scarcity deeply and do not waste sats.<br />Since they understand Bitcoin’s rarity,<br />they find satisfaction in just saving.<br />Though opportunities to spend sats surround them,<br />they prefer restraint.<br /><br />They are content with simple pleasures,<br />pleased by lasting quality,<br />satisfied with proof-of-work,<br />and protective of their low time-preference.<br /><br />Though they see neighbors caught in endless spending,<br />and the noises of consumption are all around,<br />they quietly stack, leaving others in peace,<br />growing generational wealth patiently over time.</p>

    <p>True wealth is not measured;<br />measured wealth is not true.<br />Bitcoiners do not hoard;<br />those who hoard are not bitcoiners.<br />Those who value time do not worship money;<br />those who worship money do not value time.<br /><br />The wise bitcoiner accumulates sats<br />only to enrich their time;<br />and the more they enrich others,<br />the richer they become.<br /><br />Fixing the money will bring prosperity to all, doing harm to none. <br />The bitcoiner knows this: using sound money to repair what is broken,<br />and opposing himself to fiat injustice.</p>
