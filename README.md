# justsaybits.org Next.js Site

This repo contains a minimal Next.js implementation of the justsaybits.org website. It uses Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components and Framer Motion for subtle animations. All original colors, layout, and functionality like dark mode, drawer navigation, and the music player are preserved.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
